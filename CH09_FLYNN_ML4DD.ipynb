    "*This notebook contains the code examples in chapter 9. For readability, the chapter notebooks only contain runnable code blocks and section titles. They omit the rest of the material in the book, i.e., text paragraphs, figures (unless generated as part of one of the code blocks), equations, and pseudocode. I recommend reading the notebooks side-by-side with the book!*\n",
